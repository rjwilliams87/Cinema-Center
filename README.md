#Cinema Center
A single web page to watch the latest movie trailers, get information about new releases and find movie recommendations. 

Inspiration
-----------
I've spent countless amounts of time searching various resources to find information about the latest movies. "When is the release
date?" "How long is it?" "What's the viewer rating?" Cinema Center makes it easy for users to get all the information they need about
the latest movies.
